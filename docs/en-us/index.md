On this page, you will find so-called runtime packages for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central On-Premise environments. These are pre-compiled Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Centrall app packages that you can use in your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central On-Premise environment.
It is important to select the correct platform version for your version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

The runtime packages are generally intended for use with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central On-Premise environments. If you are using a cloud environment, you should obtain the corresponding packages via the Microsoft AppSource marketplace.
