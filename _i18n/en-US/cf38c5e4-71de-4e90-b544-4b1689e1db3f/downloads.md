365 business E-Invoice is currently not offered as a runtime package.

A runtime package is a precompiled application package that you can use in your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central On-Premise installation. It is important to use the correct version for the platform version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central that you are using.

Due to the minimum requirements of 365 business E-Invoice, through the implementation based on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central E-Document Framework (available from 2024 Release Wave 2), it is not currently practical to generate runtime packages.

> **Note:**<br>If you are using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central 2022 Release Wave 1 (20.0) or newer and are interested in 365 business E-Invoice, please contact us. We will be happy to create an individual offer for you to downgrade to a supported platform version.
